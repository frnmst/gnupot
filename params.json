However \r\nthese services have some defects:\r\n- Your data could be anywhere in the world.\r\n  - This means you don't have full control over your own files.\r\n- Size limits\r\n  - Usually of a few Gigabytes.\r\n- Clients used to access these servces are usually proprietary.\r\n- These programs are also heavy (in terms of disk, memory and processor usage).\r\n- What are you going to do if those *owners* close the services?\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to have a completely free (as in freedom) \r\nreplacement for Dropbox (and also similar services) that runs exclusively in \r\nour computers. All of this is done following the *K-I-S-S* (Keep It Simple, \r\nStupid) principal.\r\n\r\n![gnupotSetup.png](/images/gnupotSetup.png)\r\n\r\n##Contact\r\n\r\nfranco.masotti@live.com or franco.masotti@student.unife.it","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
