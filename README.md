GNUpot
======
Yet another libre Dropbox clone (only for the right aspects) written in bash 
and based on git. 

##Purpose of this project

Lots of us using Dropbox (or similar) like its functionalities. However 
these services have some defects:
- Your data could be anywhere in the world.
  - This means you don't have full control over your own files.
- Size limits
  - Usually of a few Gigabytes.
- Clients used to access these servces are usually proprietary.
- These programs are also heavy (in terms of disk, memory and processor usage).
- What are you going to do if those *owners* close the services?

The aim of this project is to have a completely free (as in freedom) 
replacement for Dropbox (and also similar services) that runs exclusively in 
our computers. All of this is done following the *K-I-S-S* (Keep It Simple, 
Stupid) principal.

###Why the name GNUpot

- *GNU* beause of the freedom associated to this program.
- *pot* because it gives the idea of some type of container.

#GNUpot is looking for volunteers

Maintaining GNUpot is not as simple as it seems.

Since I'm running this project (mostly) alone, and I'm not very good with graphics, 
I'm looking for volunteers experts, in order by relevance, on:
- Graphics for creating logos and tray icons.
- pygtk, pyqt or something similar to create simple user interfaces and tray icons.
- "black belts" in git that can handle particular use cases and situations.
- Mantaining packages for non-Arch Linux based distros.
- Textual shells, i.e. bash, ksh, zsh, dash, etc... in partucular POSIX compilant shells.

And finally someone really interested in this project who is able to promote it.
 
I also need **lots of feedback and critics** based on program testing.
