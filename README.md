GNUpot
======
Yet another libre Dropbox clone (only for the right aspects) written in bash 
and based on git. 

##Purpose of this project

Lots of us using Dropbox (or similar) like its functionalities. However 
these services have some defects:
- Your data could be anywhere in the world.
  - This means you don't have full control over your own files.
- Size limits
  - Usually of a few Gigabytes.
- Clients used to access these servces are usually proprietary.
- These programs are also heavy (in terms of disk, memory and processor usage).
- What are you going to do if those *owners* close the services?

The aim of this project is to have a completely free (as in freedom) 
replacement for Dropbox (and also similar services) that runs exclusively in 
our computers. All of this is done following the *K-I-S-S* (Keep It Simple, 
Stupid) principal.

###Why the name GNUpot

- *GNU* beause of the freedom associated to this program.
- *pot* because it gives the idea of some type of container.
