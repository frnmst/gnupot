# GNUpot is looking for volunteers

Maintaining GNUpot is not as simple as it seems.

Since I'm running this project (mostly) alone, and I'm not very good with graphics, 
I'm looking for volunteers experts, in order by relevance, on:
- Graphics for creating logos and tray icons.
- pygtk, pyqt or something similar to create simple user interfaces and tray icons.
- "black belts" in git that can handle particular use cases and situations.
- Mantaining packages for non-Arch Linux based distros.
- Textual shells, i.e. bash, ksh, zsh, dash, etc... in partucular POSIX compilant shells.

And finally someone really interested in this project who is able to promote it.
 
I also need **lots of feedback and critics** based on program testing.
